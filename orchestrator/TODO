* Change the message towards xDPd, in order to select the openflow version
	This requires changes in the node_orchestrator plugin on xDPd
     
* Patrick:
	Commands.h/cc in the OvS plugin MUST be a class
	Use the constant TMP_XML_FILE (see ovs_constants.h) instead of the embedded name for the tmp file containing the XML to be sent to OvS
		Is this file necessary? It looks strange..
