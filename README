This repository contains the Universal Node orchestrator (un-orchestrator), an 
orchestration module that, given a Network Function - Forwarding Graph (NF-FG) 
deploys it. To this purpose, it interacts with a virtual switch in order to
configure the paths among the NFs, and with an hypervisor in order to properly
start the required NFs.

The repository also includes the Name Resolver, a module that provides a set
of implementations for a given NF. It is exploited by the un-orcehestrator each
time that a NF must be started.
